   :alt: Code Coverage

A package for calculating electricity-related emissions and costs for optimization problem formulation and other computational analyses.

Useful Commands
===============

1. ``pip install -e .``

  This will install your package in editable mode.

2. ``pytest electric_emission_cost/tests --cov=electric_emission_cost --cov-report=html``

  Produces an HTML test coverage report for the entire project which can
  be found at ``htmlcov/index.html``.

3. ``docs/make html``

  This will generate an HTML version of the documentation which can be found
  at ``_build/html/index.html``.

4. ``flake8 electric_emission_cost --count --verbose --show-source --statistics``

  This will lint the code and share all the style errors it finds.

5. ``black electric_emission_cost``

  This will reformat the code according to strict style guidelines.

Citing `costs.py`
*****************

The development of `costs.py` was the culmination of two papers from the WE3Lab.

The convex formulation of tariff costs for optimizing flexible loads was originally developed for a case study of flexible wastewater treatment plant operation published in Environmental Science & Technology:

    Bolorinos, J., Mauter, M. S., & Rajagopal, R. Integrated energy flexibility management at wastewater treatment facilities. *Environ. Sci. Technol.* **57**, 18362-18371. (2023). DOI: `10.1021/acs.est.3c00365 <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c00365>`_

The tariff data format was published in the following data descriptor in Nature Scientific Data:
